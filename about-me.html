                    <p>
                        I'm a Brooklyn-born designer with a passion for creating<strong>
                        brands that tell stories </strong> and <strong>connect deeply</strong>
                        with audiences. Growing up in the Y2K era, I was heavily influenced by 
                        anime and the vibrant culture of New York City, which 
                        shaped my creative eye and love for bold, nostalgic design.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In 2004, my family moved to Florida, and that mix of 
                        cultures—Brooklyn's grit and Florida's laid-back 
                        vibe—deeply impacted how I see the world and approach design.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> 
                        My journey into design began during the 2020 lock downs, 
                        where I discovered my love for design thinking and honed
                        my skills through hands-on experience, like volunteering
                        for an e-sports team. That experience taught me the 
                        importance of deadlines, budgets, and the marketing side 
                        of design—skills I later refined by going back to school 
                        and graduating in 2024.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> 
                        But my story doesn't start there. Before design, I served 
                        in the <strong>Marine Corps</strong>,stationed at Kaneohe
                        Bay, Hawaii. Immersed in the rich cultures of Hawaii 
                        and the diverse backgrounds of my fellow Marines, I 
                        gained a deeper appreciation for <strong>perspective</strong>,
                        <strong>connection</strong>, and the power of storytelling. 
                        Those lessons, along with the <strong>discipline</strong>
                        and <strong>resilience</strong> I learned in the Corps, 
                        still guide me today—whether I'm leading as a design 
                        instructor assistant or working closely with clients to 
                        bring their visions to life.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        For me, design is more than just creating visuals—it's 
                        about being of service. I know how important it is to 
                        have a strong brand in today's online world, and I see 
                        myself as a guide, helping my clients build the dream 
                        brands they deserve. From structured processes to creative 
                        problem-solving, I'm here to make the journey seamless 
                        and impactful.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        When I'm not designing, you'll find me embracing the 
                        outdoors, running, or hiking—activities that keep me 
                        grounded and inspired. I believe in designing not just 
                        brands, but a life filled with purpose, clarity, and connection.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Let's build something <strong>unforgettable</strong> together.
