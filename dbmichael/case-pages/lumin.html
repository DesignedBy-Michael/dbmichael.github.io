            <h2>Client Background</h2>
            <p> 
                The <strong>Orlando Film Festival</strong> is an immersive eight-day experience 
                that includes more than 300 films and industry panels and workshops, 
                all geared toward the hundreds of indie filmmakers and thousands 
                in attendance.
            </p>
           
            <p>
                Nightly parties and a variety of professional activities encourage 
                important networking opportunities. The festival culminates with 
                an award ceremony featuring prizes valued at more than one million dollars.

            <h2>Challenges Face</h2>
            <p>
                One of the main challenges I faced from working on this project 
                was that the client did not have any direction that they wanted 
                to go in; it was completely free range. The reason why this is 
                a challenge is because having that much free will makes you prone 
                to dislike the final project. 
            </p>
               
            <p>
                So to combat that, I made sure I was in complete communication 
                with the organizers of the OFF to 
                ensure that time wouldn't be wasted. Time was also a huge factor, 
                as when I started this project, there were only a few weeks before 
                the final design needed to be printed and shipped to the event.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once again, communication was the main factor that took me from 
                failure to success.
            </p>

            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <p>
                Just like every project I work on, I always start with word maps 
                and mood boards. These tactics are a way to help my mind focus 
                as well as a way to allow ideas to flow. It is a systematic 
                approach that allows designers to deconstruct and comprehend the 
                essence of brand language, opening the way for the development 
                of visually appealing and resonant brand identities.
            </p>


            <p>
                After I finish word mapping, I like to hop onto Pinterest and 
                create a mood board (above) to help me visualize different ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mood board is an important step in the design process because 
                I get to see different styles and pull inspiration from many 
                different areas of design. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I have the word mapping and mood board complete, I like to 
                start sketching my ideas. At this point in the process, I don't 
                judge what comes out; I just allow my thoughts and ideas to flow 
                onto the paper.
            </p>

            <p>
                I find that when I work this way, ideas come naturally and at 
                mass, and picking and choosing what ideas to follow usually 
                puts a stop to the creative process.
            </p>

            <h2>Ready For Design</h2>
            <p>
                After the sketches are complete, it's time to take them into Illustrator!
            </p>

            <h2>Poster Breakdown</h2>
            <p>
                With all the leg work completed, the design of the poster is 
                much easier. After a few iterations and speaking with the 
                clients, we decided on this version of the poster.
            </p>
